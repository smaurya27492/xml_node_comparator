# xml_node_comparator
XML comparator for comparing the XML nodes and values .

Unlike other XML comparator , this comparator compares the node at any level 
if the node and value is not in the same line then too it will compare the nodes and will provide the mismatches .
even if any state values are associated with the nodes our comparator provides that liberty to show the state value associated .
